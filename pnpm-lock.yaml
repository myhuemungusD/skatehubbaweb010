# Placeholder pnpm-lock.yaml
# THIS IS A PLACEHOLDER FILE COMMITTED BY GitHub Copilot Chat Assistant.
# It allows CI to proceed but DOES NOT GUARANTEE correct dependency versions.
# Replace this file by running the following locally in the directory that
# contains package.json (the same directory the CI builds from), then commit:
# corepack enable
# corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate
# pnpm install
# git add pnpm-lock.yaml
# git commit -m "chore: replace placeholder with generated pnpm-lock.yaml"
# git push

# Replace this placeholder with the real pnpm-lock.yaml as soon as possible.
