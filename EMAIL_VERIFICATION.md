# Email Verification System

## 🔐 Overview

Your authentication system now **requires email verification** before users can access protected routes. This is adapted from your React Router code to work with **Wouter routing**.

## 📋 What Was Implemented

### 1. **Updated Auth Functions** (`client/src/lib/auth.ts`)

**`registerUser(email, password)`**
- Creates Firebase account
- **Sends verification email** with link to `/verified`
- Does NOT auto-login (requires verification first)

**`loginUser(email, password)`**
- Checks if email is verified
- **Blocks login** if email not verified
- Shows error: "Please verify your email before logging in"
- Creates backend session only after verification

**`listenToAuth(callback)`**
- Real-time auth state listener
- Used by ProtectedRoute component

### 2. **ProtectedRoute Component** (`client/src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx`)

Wraps protected pages and enforces:
- ✅ User must be logged in
- ✅ Email must be verified
- Redirects to `/signin` if not logged in
- Redirects to `/verify` if email not verified

### 3. **New Pages**

**`/verify`** - Email verification instructions
- Shows after signup
- Tells user to check email
- Link to go back to signin

**`/verified`** - Email verified success
- Firebase redirects here after email click
- Shows success message
- Auto-redirects to `/signin` in 3 seconds

## 🚀 User Flow

### Sign Up Flow:
1. User fills `/signup` form
2. Firebase creates account
3. **Verification email sent** 📧
4. Redirect to `/verify` page
5. User checks email and clicks link
6. Redirected to `/verified` success page
7. Auto-redirect to `/signin`

### Login Flow:
1. User tries to login at `/signin`
2. If **email not verified** → Error + logout
3. If **email verified** → Create session + redirect home

### Protected Routes:
- `/map` - Requires verified email
- `/skate-game` - Requires verified email
- `/tutorial` - Requires verified email
- Other pages remain public

## 🛡️ Security Features

✅ **Email verification required** before login
✅ **Protected routes** check verification status
✅ **Real-time auth state** with Firebase listener
✅ **Automatic logout** if attempting unverified login
✅ **Session tokens** stored after verification

## 📂 Files Modified

- `client/src/lib/auth.ts` - Added email verification
- `client/src/pages/signup.tsx` - Redirect to verify page
- `client/src/pages/verify.tsx` - NEW verification instructions
- `client/src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx` - NEW route protection
- `client/src/App.tsx` - Added verify route + protected routes

## 🎯 Routes Summary

**Public Routes:**
- `/` - Landing page
- `/signup` - Sign up
- `/signin` - Sign in
- `/verify` - Verification instructions
- `/verified` - Verification success
- `/shop`, `/closet`, `/donate` - Public pages

**Protected Routes (Email Verification Required):**
- `/map` - Map check-ins
- `/skate-game` - Remote SKATE game
- `/tutorial` - Tutorial system

## ✨ Key Differences from React Router Version

Your code used **React Router** (`useNavigate`, `Navigate`, `BrowserRouter`)
This implementation uses **Wouter** (`useLocation`, `Redirect`, `Router`)

All functionality is identical - just adapted to your routing library!
